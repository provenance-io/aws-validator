# Demo AWS Based Provenance Validator

## Background

This repository provides a reference for the pre-requisites for running a Provenance Validator on AWS. An accompanying blog post can be found [here](TODO link).

- [AMIs](ami/README.md) - Public AMIs are published to all AWS US regions, but can be built from source as well
- [Terraform](terraform/READEME.md) - Minimal infrastructure setup to go from zero to Provenance signing the fastest
